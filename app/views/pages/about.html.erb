        <li class="my-2">
          it is a web application
          made for event organizers, hosts, or anyone who organizes an event where meals are served (eg. birthday
          parties, weddings, gallery vernissages, etc.)
          you can involve caterers
        </li>
        <li class="my-2">
          the goal of this application: the app helps organizers and hosts to know in advance of the event their guests
          food restrictions. Thus, makes it possible that every guest can find the meal she/he can consume. So everyone
          is happy! ðŸŽ‰
        </li>
        <li class="my-2">
          the app can list multiple events. You can create a new event any time you want. Each event shows a chart with
          all the food restricions + and a list of guests, which makes it possible to add or delete guests.
        </li>
        <li class="my-2">
          the app has an email sending possibility, a confirmation, a login-logout, a password verification, an
          automatic chart generator, a pdf creator, a list of checkboxes (for the food restrictions), and many more
          features.
