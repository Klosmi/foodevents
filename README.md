# 🥐☕️🍽 Custom Food 🥪🍷🍰
### What is Custom Food?
- it is a web application
- made for event organizers, hosts, or anyone who organizes an event where meals are served (eg. birthday parties, weddings, gallery vernissage, etc.)
- you can involve caterers
- the goal of this application: the application helps organizers and hosts to know in advance of the event their guests food restrictions. Thus, makes it possible that every guest can find the meal she/he can consume. So everyone is happy! 🎉
- the app can list multiple events. Each event shows a chart with all the food restricions + and a list of guests, which makes it possible to add or delete guests.

[^1]: This application created as a teamwork (with [Linda-ounissi](https://github.com/Linda-ounissi) and (lindak3205)[https://github.com/lindak3205]) during Le Wagon / Marseille bootcamp.
